lighttpd (1.4.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Lighttpd must load mod_auth first, else some other modules may not work
  properly (See #419176). For this reason, mod_status configuration has been
  moved out from lighttpd.conf and put in conf-available/10-status.conf.

  Also the files 10-auth.conf are automatically renamed by the lighttpd
  package (provided that a sane environment is met) into 05-auth.conf, and
  symlinks (if they exists) are also updated properly.

  This is done to ensure that auth.conf is loaded first. If during your
  lighttpd upgrade you read:

    Not touching .../10-auth.conf because .../05-auth.conf exists !!!
    Please read /usr/share/doc/lighttpd/NEWS.Debian

  then you probably have both 10-auth.conf and 05-auth.conf, which is a bad
  situation that you should fix.
